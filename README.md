# Crop Management API

## Overview
Crop Management API is a Node.js application built using Express.js for managing crop data. It provides a RESTful interface for performing CRUD operations on crop information. This API can be used by agricultural businesses, farmers, or any other stakeholders involved in crop management.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing crop data.
- **dotenv**: A module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **colors**: A library for adding color to console output.
- **cors**: A middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move to the directory containing the cloned repository.
   ```
   cd crop-management-api
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm (Node Package Manager) to install the required dependencies.
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the necessary environment variables. For example:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cropDB
   ```
5. **Start the Server**: Run the server using npm.
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.
- Use a tool such as Postman, cURL, or a web browser to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
- By default, the server runs on port 5000. You can customize this by setting the `PORT` environment variable in the `.env` file.

## API Endpoints
### Crop Routes
- **GET `/api/crops`**: Retrieve all crops.
- **GET `/api/crops/:id`**: Retrieve a single crop by its ID.

## Configuration
- The API is configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:3000` by default due to the CORS configuration. You can modify this in the `corsOptions` variable in the code if needed.

## Error Handling
- The API includes custom error handling middleware (`errorHandler` and `notFound`) to manage errors gracefully.
